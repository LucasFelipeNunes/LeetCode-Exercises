# LeetCode Exercises

This repository contains the exercises I am doing on LeetCode, in Java and JavaScript languages. Each folder contains the class of the exercise itself, named "Solution", a class that helps implementing it if necessary, named Main, and the auxiliar classes that are required for the exercises.
